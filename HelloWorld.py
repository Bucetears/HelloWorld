# our computers to the world, and help them welcome the world back!

#This right here is a function which is not necessary to running code in Python.
def sayHello():
    #This code below is all you really need to have your computer greet you.
    print("Hello World!")
    #The print statement causes text or numbers to appear on the terminal.
    #Anything in the quotation marks will be printed to the terminal.

#This is how we run the function, by calling it down here below.
