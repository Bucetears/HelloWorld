# Overview

This is a happy program in which we help our computers greet the world by printing the words
"Hello World" onto the terminal. This program was made to help me increase my skills as a Software Engineer
so I can better understand my work by helping others understand the work as well.

This program was created as a base tutorial for people learning how to code python for the first.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code for writing and creating my code. VS code is short for Visual Studio.
I also used GitHub to upload my code to be on the internet and share it with others.

I used Python Language to write my code as well as I used Mark Down for the ReadMe document.
